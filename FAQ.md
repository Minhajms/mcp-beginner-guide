# MCP Beginner's Guide: Frequently Asked Questions

## Understanding MCP Basics

### What exactly is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
MCP is a standardized protocol that defines how applications can communicate with AI models. It provides a structured way for:
1. Applications to request AI capabilities
2. AI models to access tools and resources
3. Results to be returned in a consistent format

Think of it as an API standard specifically designed for AI interactions.

### Why do we need MCP?
Without MCP, every application would need to implement its own way of:
- Formatting requests to AI models
- Providing tools for AI models to use
- Handling responses from AI models

MCP standardizes these interactions, making it easier to build AI-powered applications.

### What are the core components of MCP?
1. **MCP Host**: Manages communication between clients and the server
2. **MCP Client**: Application that sends requests to the MCP server
3. **MCP Server**: Processes requests and provides AI capabilities
4. **MCP Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients
5. **MCP Tools**: Functions that can be called by the AI model
6. **MCP Prompts**: Pre-written templates for specific tasks

## MCP Components in This Project

### What serves as the MCP Host in this project?
The `mcp_server.py` file with its FastAPI application serves as the MCP Host. It:
- Exposes endpoints for receiving requests
- Routes requests to the appropriate handlers
- Returns structured responses

### What is the MCP Client in this project?
The `cli.py` file serves as the MCP Client. It:
- Parses command-line arguments
- Formats them into proper MCP requests
- Sends requests to the MCP server
- Displays responses to the user

### What is the MCP Server in this project?
The `LocalDevAssistantMCP` class in `mcp_server.py` acts as the MCP Server. It:
- Processes incoming requests
- Routes them to appropriate tools
- Communicates with the AI model (Ollama)
- Returns structured responses

### How are MCP Resources implemented?
MCP Resources in this project include:
- **File contents**: Accessed via `_read_file` method
- **Project listings**: Provided by `_list_projects` method
- **Analysis results**: Generated from code analysis

Example:
```python
def _read_file(self, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Read a file"""
    file_path = params.get("path", "")
    if not file_path:
        return {"success": False, "error": "File path is required"}
    
    return self.file_tools.read_file(file_path)
```

### How are MCP Tools implemented?
MCP Tools in this project include:
- **Project creation**: `_create_project` method
- **Code generation**: `_generate_code` method
- **File operations**: `_read_file`, `_write_file` methods
- **Command execution**: `_run_command` method

Example:
```python
def _generate_code(self, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate code using Ollama"""
    prompt = params.get("prompt", "")
    language = params.get("language", "python")
    
    if not prompt:
        return {"success": False, "error": "Code prompt is required"}
    
    # Enhanced prompt for code generation
    enhanced_prompt = f"""Generate {language} code for: {prompt}
    ...
```

### How are MCP Prompts implemented?
MCP Prompts in this project include:
- **System prompt**: Defined in `self.system_prompt` in the MCP server
- **Code generation prompt**: Enhanced prompts for code generation
- **Analysis prompt**: Template for code analysis

Example:
```python
# System prompt for the assistant
self.system_prompt = """You are a Local Development Assistant. You help developers by:

1. Creating project structures and files
2. Generating code based on requirements
3. Managing development workflows
4. Providing coding assistance and explanations
...
```

## MCP Request/Response Flow

### How does a request flow through the MCP system?
1. User enters a command in the CLI
2. CLI formats it as an MCP request with action and parameters
3. Request is sent to the MCP server
4. Server identifies the appropriate tool to handle the request
5. If needed, the server communicates with the AI model (Ollama)
6. Server formats the response
7. Response is returned to the CLI
8. CLI displays the result to the user

### What does an MCP request look like?
An MCP request has this structure:
```python
{
    "action": "generate_code",  # The action to perform
    "parameters": {             # Parameters for the action
        "prompt": "function to read CSV file",
        "language": "python"
    },
    "context": None             # Optional context information
}
```

### What does an MCP response look like?
An MCP response has this structure:
```python
{
    "success": True,            # Whether the request succeeded
    "data": {                   # The response data
        "code": "def read_csv(file_path):\n    ...",
        "language": "python"
    },
    "message": "Code generated successfully",  # Human-readable message
    "error": None               # Error message if success is False
}
```

## Practical MCP Questions

### How do I add a new MCP tool?
1. Add a new method to the `LocalDevAssistantMCP` class:
```python
def _my_new_tool(self, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """My new tool description"""
    # Tool implementation
    return {
        "success": True,
        "data": result,
        "message": "Tool executed successfully"
    }
```

2. Register the tool in the `__init__` method:
```python
self.tools = {
    # Existing tools...
    "my_new_tool": self._my_new_tool
}
```

3. Add a CLI command in `cli.py` to use the new tool

### How do I create a custom MCP client?
You can create a custom MCP client by:
1. Creating a class that formats requests according to the MCP standard
2. Sending HTTP requests to the MCP server
3. Processing the responses

Example:
```python
import requests

class MyMCPClient:
    def __init__(self, server_url="http://localhost:8000"):
        self.server_url = server_url
    
    def send_request(self, action, parameters=None):
        if parameters is None:
            parameters = {}
        
        request = {
            "action": action,
            "parameters": parameters
        }
        
        response = requests.post(f"{self.server_url}/mcp", json=request)
        return response.json()
```

### How does the AI model (Ollama) fit into the MCP architecture?
Ollama is not part of the MCP architecture itself, but rather a service that the MCP server uses to provide AI capabilities. The MCP server:
1. Formats prompts for the AI model
2. Sends requests to Ollama
3. Processes the responses
4. Returns the results in the MCP response format

This separation allows the MCP server to potentially use different AI models without changing the MCP interface.

## Common MCP Misconceptions

### Is MCP only for AI applications?
While MCP is designed with AI in mind, its principles of structured requests, tools, and resources can be applied to any application that needs a standardized way to access capabilities.

### Does MCP require a specific AI model?
No, MCP is model-agnostic. This project uses Ollama with the llama3.2 model, but you could replace it with any other AI model or service.

### Is MCP the same as an API?
MCP is a specific type of API designed for AI interactions. It has specialized components like tools, resources, and prompts that are tailored for AI use cases.

### Does MCP require a web server?
While this project uses FastAPI to implement the MCP server, MCP itself is a protocol that could be implemented in various ways, including in-process communication without a web server.

## Troubleshooting MCP

### My MCP request is failing. How do I debug it?
1. Check that the action name is correct and registered in the tools dictionary
2. Verify that all required parameters are provided
3. Check for any error messages in the response
4. Add logging to the MCP server to trace the request flow

### How do I handle authentication in MCP?
This simple project doesn't implement authentication, but in a production MCP server, you would:
1. Add authentication middleware to the FastAPI application
2. Validate authentication tokens before processing requests
3. Implement role-based access control for different tools

### How do I scale an MCP server?
To scale an MCP server:
1. Use a production ASGI server like Uvicorn behind a reverse proxy
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
3. Use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple instances
4. Consider containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes
